# 🔧 Ngrok Dashboard Port Clarification

## 🤔 **The Confusion**
You noticed the hardcoded port 4040 in the dashboard URL and thought it should match the server port. Let me clarify the ngrok architecture:

## 🏗️ **Ngrok Architecture**

### **Three Different Ports:**

1. **🌐 Server Port** (Dynamic: 6011 in your example)
   - Where your Face Swap Live server runs
   - Changes each time (dynamic allocation)
   - Example: `http://localhost:6011`

2. **📊 Ngrok Dashboard Port** (Fixed: 4040)
   - Where ngrok's web interface runs
   - Always 4040 by default (ngrok standard)
   - Example: `http://localhost:4040`

3. **🔗 Public Tunnel URL** (Dynamic subdomain)
   - The public URL that forwards to your server
   - Example: `https://0c3007c6d6bc.ngrok-free.app`

### **How They Connect:**
```
Internet → https://0c3007c6d6bc.ngrok-free.app → localhost:6011 (your server)
                                                      ↑
                                              Monitor via localhost:4040 (dashboard)
```

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Made Dashboard Port Configurable**
```python
# Now you can customize if needed
manager = NgrokManager(dashboard_port=4040)  # Default
manager = NgrokManager(dashboard_port=4041)  # Custom
```

### **2. Added Dashboard Verification**
```python
def _check_dashboard_accessible(self) -> bool:
    """Check if ngrok dashboard is accessible"""
    try:
        response = requests.get(self.dashboard_url, timeout=1)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except Exception:
        return False
```

### **3. Enhanced Tunnel Information Display**
```python
# Now shows:
📡 Public URL: https://0c3007c6d6bc.ngrok-free.app
🔒 Protocol: HTTPS
🏠 Local Server: localhost:6011  # ← Shows actual server port
🔧 Ngrok Dashboard: http://localhost:4040 ✅  # ← Shows dashboard status
```

### **4. Better Logging**
```python
[18:03:22] INFO: ✅ Tunnel verified - Server will start on port 6011
[18:03:22] INFO: 🔗 Tunnel: https://0c3007c6d6bc.ngrok-free.app -> localhost:6011
```

## 🎯 **The Correct Behavior**

### **✅ Port 4040 IS Correct for Dashboard**
- Ngrok always uses port 4040 for its web interface
- This is separate from your server port
- You can monitor tunnel traffic, replay requests, etc.

### **✅ Your Server Port (6011) IS Correct**
- This is where your Face Swap Live server runs
- The tunnel forwards public traffic to this port
- This port changes dynamically (which is good)

### **✅ The Coordination Works Perfectly**
```bash
# Your logs show perfect coordination:
Found available port: 6011          # ← Server will use this
Starting ngrok tunnel for port 6011  # ← Tunnel points to this
Tunnel verified: ... -> localhost:6011  # ← Confirmed working
Server URL: http://0.0.0.0:6011     # ← Server started on this
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
export NGROK_DASHBOARD_PORT=4041  # Custom dashboard port
export NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
python app.py --ngrok
```

### **Command Line:**
```bash
# The server port is handled automatically
python app.py --ngrok --port 8080  # Server + tunnel both use 8080
python app.py --ngrok              # Server + tunnel both use dynamic port
```

## 📊 **Dashboard Features**

Visit `http://localhost:4040` to:
- ✅ **Monitor Traffic**: See all requests to your tunnel
- ✅ **Replay Requests**: Debug issues by replaying requests
- ✅ **View Tunnel Status**: Confirm tunnel is working
- ✅ **Inspect Headers**: See what data is being sent

## 🎉 **Summary**

**The port 4040 was actually correct!** It's ngrok's standard dashboard port, not your server port. The improvements I made:

1. ✅ **Made it configurable** (in case you need a different dashboard port)
2. ✅ **Added verification** (confirms dashboard is accessible)
3. ✅ **Enhanced logging** (shows the relationship between all ports)
4. ✅ **Better documentation** (clarifies the architecture)

Your Face Swap Live server is working perfectly with ngrok! 🎭✨

**Key Takeaway**: Three different ports, three different purposes, all working together perfectly! 🚀
